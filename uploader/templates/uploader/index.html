        <h3>Teachers</h3>
        <p>This site will allow you to share and find relevant resources, bookmarks,
        notes and tests. They are based around syllabuses so they should be 
        relevant to the content you are teaching.</p>
        <h3>Students</h3>
        <p>For your specific course, we have materials such as notes and tests
        to help you learn and revise</p>
        <a href="{% url 'uploader:subjects' %}">
            <button class='btn'>
                Bring on the subjects
            </button>
            
        </a>
        <!--
        <p>
            Why another teaching resource site? We all know that teachers are 
            re-inventing the wheel with resources despite the fact there's lots 
            of great resources out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest problem is that resources that are aimed at specific 
            courses are harder to find than generic ones. A resource teaching 
            fractions to 11 year olds is going to be different from those for 16 
            year olds. <strong>{{ SITE_NAME }}</strong>'s aim is to try and collect the best resources 
            for each exam syllabus rather than try to collect as many resources 
            as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time the site will become smarter, similiar topics will be 
            linked and resources will be shared between exam boards where 
            appropriate.
        </p>-->
