        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Why another teaching resource site? We all know that teachers are 
            re-inventing the wheel with resources despite the fact there's lots 
            of great resources out there.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest problem is that resources that are aimed at specific 
            courses are harder to find than generic ones. A resource teaching 
            fractions to 11 year olds is going to be different from those for 16 
            year olds. <strong>openTeach</strong>'s aim is to try and collect the best resources 
            for each exam syllabus rather than try to collect as many resources 
            as possible.
        </p>
        <p>>
            Over time the site will become smarter, similiar topics will be 
            linked and resources will be shared between exam boards where 
            appropriate.
